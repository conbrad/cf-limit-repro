591474922,Text Editor Data Structures,,"Text editors can be an interesting challenge to program. The types of problems that text editors need to solve can range from trivial to mind-bogglingly difficult. Recently, I have been on something of a spiritual journey to rework some internal data structures in an editor I have been building, specifically the most fundamental data structure to any text editor: the text.Table of Contents Resources Why? In The Beginning Investigation My Own Piece Tree fredbuf ConclusionResourcesBefore we dive into what I have done here it is important to call out some very useful resources I found for building your own text editor: Build Your Own Text Editor - Probably the most fundamental text editor from scratch blog post I’ve seen. This is an excellent tutorial if you are looking to get started on creating your own text editor. It’s worthwhile to note that the editor in this tutorial uses, essentially, a vector of lines as its internal data structure for text. Text Editor: Data Structures - A great overview of several data structures that one could use when implementing a text editor. (Spoiler: at least one of these will be covered in this post) Ded (Text Editor) YouTube playlist - This is a fantastic series in which @tscoding goes through the process of building a text editor from scratch and served as the inspiration for me going down this rabbit hole in the first place.Why?If there are so many good resources out there for building your own text editor (let’s also ignore the fact that there already exists phenomenal text editors today), why am I writing this? There are a few reasons: I wanted to push myself into a project kind that I’ve never tried before. I wanted to create a tool that I might actually use. Building my own data structures have always been something I wanted to tackle more of.I went through the process of implementing my own data structure specifically because I observed a problem in my program where using something off-the-shelf would not exactly address the concerns I had or provide the flexibility I need. Furthermore, the entire project of writing my own text editor is very much inspired from Handmade Community so everything is built from scratch. If I used an existing solution here I feel it would have been a disservice to the spirit on which the editor is built.In The Beginning…I am a strong believer in “experiment and get things working as fast as possible”—essentially, a fail fast mentality. This is not to say that your first pass should ignore optimization, and I refuse to pessimize my code. That said, I started from the simplest possible representation of a text file to start: a giant string.There are some pretty great properties of having a single string as your text buffer: It is the most compact possible representation. The algorithms for insertion and removal are simple. It is very friendly to the rendering process because you can slice up the string into views which can be independently rendered without additional allocation. Did I mention it is simple?Here’s a short example of insertion and deletion:void insert_buffer(Editor::Data* data, std::string_view buf){ auto old_size = data-buf.size(); data-buf.resize(data-buf.size() + buf.size()); auto insert_at = next(begin(data-buf), rep(data-cursor)); auto end_range = next(begin(data-buf), old_size); // First splat the buffer on the end, then rotate it to where // it needs to be. std::copy(begin(buf), end(buf), end_range); std::rotate(insert_at, end_range, end(data-buf)); data-need_save = true;}void remove_range(Editor::Data* data, CharOffset first, CharOffset last){ auto remove_start = next(begin(data-buf), rep(first)); auto remove_last = next(begin(data-buf), rep(last)); auto removed_begin = std::rotate(remove_start, remove_last, end(data-buf)); data-buf.erase(removed_begin, end(data-buf)); data-need_save = true;}Note: Yes, the algorithms above could be simplified by just calling buf.insert or buf.erase but the code above just expands the the work that would otherwise be done in those STL functions and do not change the overall complexity.But, oh boy, do the drawbacks hit hard. If you want to work with any file beyond 1MB, good luck. Not only do you really start to feel those linear time operations but if the underlying buffer needs to reallocate after some edits the entire process slows to a crawl as you need to allocate a larger buffer and copy each byte into the new buffer and destroy the old one. It can turn an O(n) operation into O(n^2) randomly.There is another, more subtle, drawback to using a giant text buffer: how do you implement undo/redo? The most obvious approach would be to have a separate data structure that tracks all of the individual insertions and deletes. Insertions are much easier to track as you can store them as a range of offsets and simply discard them from the original buffer if the undo operation is invoked. Deletions are a bit more tricky, as with the big string approach you really do need to store a small buffer containing the characters which were removed and the offset from which they were extracted. Something like this would work:#include #include enum class CharOffset : std::size_t { };struct InsertionData{ CharOffset first; CharOffset last;};struct DeletionData{ std::string deleted_buf; CharOffset from;};struct UndoRedoData{ enum class Kind { Insertion, Deletion }; Kind kind; union { InsertionData ins; DeletionData del; }; UndoRedoData(InsertionData ins): kind{ Kind::Insertion }, ins{ ins } { } UndoRedoData(DeletionData del): kind{ Kind::Deletion }, del{ del } { } ~UndoRedoData() { switch (kind) { case Kind::Insertion: ins.~InsertionData(); break; case Kind::Deletion: del.~DeletionData(); break; } }};but is overly complicated and requires potentially large allocation overheads when deleting large portions of text. There must be a better way…InvestigationI knew I wanted to solve all the problems that having a single giant text buffer had, so my concrete goals are as follows: Efficient insertion/deletion. Efficient undo/redo. Must be flexible enough to enable UTF-8 encoding. Efficient multi-cursor editing.Gap bufferI initially started going down the path of a gap buffer. The gap buffer is very simple to implement and Emacs famously uses a gap buffer as its data structure. A gap buffer would address the first point quite well for isolated edits. It’s not very common that I am editing all over the file all at once, is it? Well… Not quite. One of my favorite (perhaps gimmicky) features of modern text editors is multi-cursor editing (sometimes called block-style edits, though block-style editing is slightly different) and after reading “Gap Buffers Are Not Optimized for Multiple Cursors” (which, btw, has one of the best animations I’ve ever seen to describe a gap buffer in action) Chris Wellons thoroughly convinced me that gap buffers are the wrong way to go because multi-cursor edits are important to me.Gap buffers are also plagued with similar problems as the giant string representation where efficient undo/redo is difficult without lots of extra storage/data structures. Efficient insertion/deletion. Efficient undo/redo. Must be flexible enough to enable UTF-8 encoding. Efficient multi-cursor editing.Gap buffer is out.RopeA rope can be a very attractive data structure for text editors. A rope has a lot of nice properties for editing in particular because it splits the file up into several smaller allocations which allow for very fast amortized insertions or deletions at any point in the file, O(lg n). At first glance, it would seem that a rope addresses all of my initial concerns because operations like undo/redo can more easily be implemented in terms of a tree snapshot (or retaining the removed or changed nodes) and multi-cursor editing becomes a much more lightweight operation.So where’s the catch? Let’s revisit undo/redo for a moment. Which represents the string “HelloWorld”. If I want to introduce a space between “Hello” and “World” then the new tree would look like: Where the node “Hello” was appended with a space at the end. The most attractive version of a rope data structure is to make the entire thing immutable, which implies that when we go to extend the node containing “Hello” we actually end up creating a new node with a fresh buffer to contain the new string or we create a new node just to hold the “ “, which seems equally as wasteful (though the rope should define some kind of constant to limit the size of each node). Copying the node on write implies that, while your undo stack will contain a lightweight version of the original tree, your newly constructed tree can expand your total memory consumption much more than you might initially think.For the purposes of my editor, I want something a bit more lightweight. Efficient insertion/deletion. Efficient undo/redo. Must be flexible enough to enable UTF-8 encoding. Efficient multi-cursor editing.Piece TableNow things are getting interesting. The piece table is a data structure that has a long history with text editors. Microsoft Word used a piece table once upon a time to implement features like fast undo/redo as well as efficient file saving. The piece table appears to check many of the boxes for me.There is one, perhaps, slight drawback. Due to the fact that the traditional piece table is implemented as a contiguous array of historical edits, it implies that long edit sessions could end up in a place where adding lots of small edits to the same file will cause some of the artifacts we saw with the giant text buffer start to appear, e.g. randomly your editor may slow down because the piece table is reallocated to a larger array. Not only this, undo/redo stacks need to store this potentially large array of entries. Efficient insertion/deletion (minus very log edit sessions). Efficient undo/redo (minus very long edit sessions). Must be flexible enough to enable UTF-8 encoding. Efficient multi-cursor editing.Then, the VSCode team went a...",https://cdacamar.github.io/data%20structures/algorithms/benchmarking/text%20editors/c++/editor-data-structures/,Algorithms,,2023-06-14T00:43:05.033Z,https://cdacamar.github.io/images/logo-og.png,
579837548,Optimizing Open Addressing,,"Your default hash table should be open-addressed, using Robin Hood linear probing with backward-shift deletion.  When prioritizing deterministic performance over memory efficiency, two-way chaining is also a good choice.  Code for this article may be found on GitHub.     Open Addressing vs. Separate Chaining   Benchmark Setup   Discussion            Separate Chaining       Linear Probing       Quadratic Probing       Double Hashing       Robin Hood Linear Probing       Two Way Chaining           Unrolling, Prefetching, and SIMD   Benchmark Data   Open Addressing vs. Separate Chaining  Most people first encounter hash tables implemented using separate chaining, a model simple to understand and analyze mathematically. In separate chaining, a hash function is used to map each key to one of \(K\) buckets.  Each bucket holds a linked list, so to retrieve a key, one simply traverses its corresponding bucket.    Given a hash function drawn from a universal family, inserting \(N\) keys into a table with \(K\) buckets results in an expected bucket size of \(\frac{N}{K}\), a quantity also known as the table’s load factor.  Assuming (reasonably) that \(\frac{N}{K}\) is bounded by a constant, all operations on such a table can be performed in expected constant time.  Unfortunately, this basic analysis doesn’t consider the myriad factors that go into implementing an efficient hash table on a real computer.  In practice, hash tables based on open addressing can provide superior performance, and their limitations can be worked around in nearly all cases.  Open Addressing  In an open-addressed table, each bucket only contains a single key.  Collisions are handled by placing additional keys elsewhere in the table.  For example, in linear probing, a key is placed in the first open bucket starting from the index it hashes to.    Unlike in separate chaining, open-addressed tables may be represented in memory as a single flat array.  A priori, we should expect operations on flat arrays to offer higher performance than those on linked structures due to more coherent memory accesses.1  However, if the user wants to insert more than \(K\) keys into an open-addressed table with \(K\) buckets, the entire table must be resized. Typically, a larger array is allocated and all current keys are moved to the new table.  The size is grown by a constant factor (e.g. 2x), so insertions occur in amortized constant time.  Why Not Separate Chaining?  In practice, the standard libraries of many languages provide separately chained hash tables, such as C++’s std::unordered_map. At least in C++, this choice is now considered to have been a mistake—it violates C++’s principle of not paying for features you didn’t ask for.  Separate chaining still has some purported benefits, but they seem unconvincing:          Separately chained tables don’t require any linear-time operations.      First, this isn’t true.  To maintain a constant load factor, separate chaining hash tables also have to resize once a sufficient number of keys are inserted, though the limit can be greater than \(K\). Most separately chained tables, including std::unordered_map, only provide amortized constant time insertion.      Second, open-addressed tables can be incrementally resized.  When the table grows, there’s no reason we have to move all existing keys right away.  Instead, every subsequent operation can move a fixed number of old keys into the new table.  Eventually, all keys will have been moved and the old table may be deallocated.  This technique incurs overhead on every operation during a resize, but none will require linear time.           When each (key + value) entry is allocated separately, entries can have stable addresses. External code can safely store pointers to them, and large entries never have to be copied.      This property is easy to support by adding a single level of indirection. That is, allocate each entry separately, but use an open-addressed table to map  keys to pointers-to-entries. In this case, resizing the table only requires copying pointers, rather than entire entries.           Lower memory overhead.      It’s possible for a separately chained table to store the same data in less space than an open-addressed equivalent, since flat tables necessarily waste space storing empty buckets. However, matching high-quality open addressing schemes (especially when storing entries indirectly) requires a load factor greater than one, degrading query performance.  Further, individually allocating nodes wastes memory due to heap allocator overhead and fragmentation.      In fact, the only situation where open addressing truly doesn’t work is when the table cannot allocate and entries cannot be moved. These requirements can arise when using intrusive linked lists, a common pattern in kernel data structures and embedded systems with no heap.  Benchmark Setup  For simplicity, let us only consider tables mapping 64-bit integer keys to 64-bit integer values.  Results will not take into account the effects of larger values or non-trivial key comparison, but should still be representative, as keys can often be represented in 64 bits and values are often pointers.  We will evaluate tables using the following metrics:    Time to insert \(N\) keys into an empty table.   Time to erase \(N\) existing keys.   Time to look up \(N\) existing keys.   Time to look up \(N\) missing keys2.   Average probe length for existing & missing keys.   Maximum probe length for existing & missing keys.   Memory amplification in a full table (total size / size of data).   Each open-addressed table was benchmarked at 50%, 75%, and 90% load factors.  Every test targeted a table capacity of 8M entries, setting \(N = \lfloor 8388608 * \text{Load Factor} \rfloor - 1\).  Fixing the table capacity allows us to benchmark behavior at exactly the specified load factor, avoiding misleading results from tables that have recently grown. The large number of keys causes each test to unpredictably traverse a data set much larger than L3 cache (128MB+), so the CPU3 cannot effectively cache or prefetch memory accesses.  Table Sizes  All benchmarked tables use exclusively power-of-two sizes.  This invariant allows us to translate hashes to array indices with a fast bitwise AND operation, since: h % 2**n == h & (2**n - 1)  Power-of-two sizes also admit a neat virtual memory trick4, but that optimization is not included here.  However, power-of-two sizes can cause pathological behavior when paired with some hash functions, since indexing simply throws away the hash’s high bits. An alternative strategy is to use prime sized tables, which are significantly more robust to the choice of hash function.  For the purposes of this post, we have a fixed hash function and non-adversarial inputs, so prime sizes were not used5.  Hash Function  All benchmarked tables use the squirrel3 hash function, a fast integer hash that (as far as I can tell) only exists in this GDC talk on noise-based RNG.  Here, it is adapted to 64-bit integers by choosing three large 64-bit primes: uint64_t squirrel3(uint64_t at) {     constexpr uint64_t BIT_NOISE1 = 0x9E3779B185EBCA87ULL;     constexpr uint64_t BIT_NOISE2 = 0xC2B2AE3D27D4EB4FULL;     constexpr uint64_t BIT_NOISE3 = 0x27D4EB2F165667C5ULL;     at *= BIT_NOISE1;     at ^= (at  8);     at += BIT_NOISE2;     at ^= (at  8);     at *= BIT_NOISE3;     at ^= (at  8);     return at; }   I make no claims regarding the quality or robustness of this hash function, but observe that it’s cheap, it produces the expected number of collisions in power-of-two tables, and it passes smhasher when applied bytewise.  Other Benchmarks  Several less interesting benchmarks were also run, all of which exhibited identical performance across equal-memory open-addressed tables and much worse performance for separate chaining.    Time to look up each element by following a Sattolo cycle6 (2-4x).   Time to clear the table (100-200x).   Time to iterate all values (3-10x).   Discussion  Separate Chaining  To get our bearings, let’s first implement a simple separate chaining table and benchmark it at various load factors.

Insertions and erasures, on the other hand, are pretty slow—they involve allocation.  Technically, the reported memory amplification in an underestimate, as it does not include heap allocator overhead.  However, we should not directly compare memory amplification against the coming open-addressed tables, as storing larger values would improve separate chaining’s ratio.  std::unordered_map  Running these benchmarks on std::unordered_map 32\).

But after reading a few white papers about this topic it turns out that these ""basics"" are about 40 years old. Over the years so many techniques were proposed in order to improve efficiency in one cases, add functionality in others or even embrace new types of hardware.

Inspired by Goetz Graefes and many other authors, we will go through the most interesting of such techniques, see why they are so cool, what kind of use cases they address and how many of them did land in PostgreSQL or other databases.

This video explains the floyd's algorithm and its proof of correctness.

1. Initialize two references: a slow reference 'S' and a fast reference 'F' to the start of the list
2. Move 'S' forward one node at a time and move 'F' forward two nodes at a time.
3. If at some point of time, reference 'S' and reference 'F' point to the same node of the list then we know that there is a loop in the list otherwise we return null saying there is no loop.
4. After the loop is detected in step #3, we move back reference 'S' to the start of the list again and keep 'F' at same meeting point.
5. Now this time around, we move both 'S' and 'F' forward one node at a time until they meet.
6. The node where they meet is start of the loop.

390444013,[PDF] HAT-Trie: A Cache-Conscious Trie-Based Data Structure For Strings | Semantic Scholar,,"The HAT-trie is shown to be the most efficient trie-based data structure for managing variable-length strings in-memory while maintaining sort order and approaching that of the cache-conscious hash table. Tries are the fastest tree-based data structures for managing strings in-memory, but are space-intensive. The burst-trie is almost as fast but reduces space by collapsing trie-chains into buckets. This is not however, a cache-conscious approach and can lead to poor performance on current processors. In this paper, we introduce the HAT-trie, a cache-conscious trie-based data structure that is formed by carefully combining existing components. We evaluate performance using several real-world datasets and against other high-performance data structures. We show strong improvements in both time and space; in most cases approaching that of the cache-conscious hash table. Our HAT-trie is shown to be the most efficient trie-based data structure for managing variable-length strings in-memory while maintaining sort order.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/HAT-Trie%3A-A-Cache-Conscious-Trie-Based-Data-For-Askitis-Sinha/cbd461aebf6c8288d7afddbb30f7b727d798044b?p2df=,Algorithms,,2021-02-23T20:21:02.000Z,https://www.semanticscholar.org/img/semantic_scholar_og.png,

For this reason they come up every now and then on LWN; one of the last mentions, which prompted me to write this article series, was last July. Topics that arise even more frequently are  read-copy-update (RCU — these articles from 2007 are still highly relevant), reference counting, and ways of wrapping lockless primitives into higher-level, more easily understood APIs.  These articles will delve into the concepts behind lockless algorithms and how they are used in the kernel.",https://lwn.net/Articles/844224,Algorithms,,2021-03-04T20:37:29.000Z,,

System design questions have become a standard part of the software engineering interview process. Performance in these interviews reflects upon your ability to work with complex systems and translates into the position and salary the interviewing company offers you. Unfortunately, most engineers struggle with SDI, partly because of their lack of experience in developing large-scale systems and partly because of the unstructured nature of SDIs. Even engineers who've some experience building such systems aren't comfortable with these interviews, mainly due to the open-ended nature of design problems that don't have a standard answer.  This course is a complete guide to master SDIs. It is created by hiring managers who've been working at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. We've carefully chosen a set of questions that have been repeatedly asked at top companies.",https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512,Amazon,,2017-12-25T08:54:14.000Z,https://educative.io/api/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512/image/5686567992557568.png,

390443208,Salary Negotiation Tips from White Men in Tech: Part 1,,"First Marcus Carey and Jennifer Jin released the @tribeofhackers book and inspired me to get back to researching to make my digital book a physical reality in 2019.    Then one of my favorite hackers @iancoldwater tweeted one of the questions that I'd planned to cover in my salary negotiations chapter:        This is an excellent response, but for some, it is the beginning of a longer conversation that some are not prepared to have.     I have been in the unfortunate position of having that response and being unprepared for follow-up questions, so I wanted to use research to help others navigate some of the dialogue that happens during negotiations.    I considered reaching out to successful women to answer the questions, and I still may. But I decided to ask white men in tech because they continue to make more money than every demographic in America regardless of skills, education, and experience.    Hired, Inc. released their State of Inequality Wage Inequality In the Workplace Report in early 2018. They found that 63% of the time, men were offered higher salaries than women for the same role at the same company. The report found that companies were offering women between 4% and a whopping 45% less starting pay for the same job. Women in tech also tended to undervalue their market worth, asking for less pay 66% of the time, and would often ask for 6% less salary than their male counterparts.Tanya Tarr @nerdette By The Numbers: What Pay Inequality Looks Like For Women In Tech, Forbes, April 4, 2018    With this in mind, I reached out to a few men to ask if they would be willing to share salary negotiation tips with women. They agreed under the condition that they could remain anonymous. I asked them to share with women how they should approach answering following questions:    What are your salary expectations?What is the salary range you're after? (because companies know we're hip to asking for a range instead of a number now)We cannot move forward without a number. What is the minimum base salary you will accept?Any other advice you would like to share?    I'd originally planned to compile all my research before publishing, but that could take weeks (months?). I was so moved by this respondent's transparency that had to publish it.     He shared tips and tea!     Even though a lot of this will spark well of course he's able to negotiate like this, he's a white man! reactions, I encourage you to read it with the intent to be empowered. I have lots of thoughts that I'll share at a later date, and look forward to hearing your feedback.    Question 1: What are your salary expectations?    After publishing this post, I was notified that @CatBailey sent the tweet above last week. I was not aware because I do not follow her, but I updated the post to illustrate a point.    Response:    If you can, find a trusted person within the org to help you set expectations. Glassdoor never ever reflects exceptional talent compensation, Blind tends to be a better reflection if you can't get direct info. Remember that large company salary budgets can be solidly 2-5x what you were making at a small company.    Ask someone in a comparable level at a different company if you have to. Find a senior dude you trust, and just flat out ask him how much he makes. More of them will be willing to tell you than you might expect. Don't ask what he thinks you should make, ask him what he makes.     Remember that for large companies, the rules around salary and comp are often MUCH looser for groups or divisions that are pioneering new tech, pushing the boundaries, or dragging the company into the 21st century. That's where you want to work anyway.    It's also worth reminding readers that if the cash salary is big enough to get by, total comp is the number you care about. In a great many cases total comp is way way more flexible than base salary - for large corps, base cash salary is often strictly banded, but RSUs or options are significantly flexible.     I've personally negotiated a doubling of the initial stock grant offer for a position where stock was more than half my comp, your counterparty often has this flexibility.    Speaking of numbers, your new employer doesn't have a solid understanding of your current comp. In California it's illegal to use that info, in other states the reported number to the agencies is often only base comp, not total including stock and bonuses. Flat out lie about your current comp, it's a valid negotiating tactic. Do it.    Editor's note: Click here to see a running list of states and localities that have outlawed pay history questions on hrdive.com    One useful negotiating tactic if you've managed to get your hiring party to name a number is to comfortably say Ok, that sounds like a reasonable base salary, but I'll need to understand how the stock works out to know if this is worth pursuing.    It gives your adversary a comfortable way out to say of course, that wasn't the whole package without embarrassing them for making a lowball offer. Practice that conversation with a role playing partner before you have it.    For positions with more than 4 years of experience, at public companies you should expect stock grants to be a significant part of your compensation. In my experience, if your total comp is 100-200k, you should negotiate at least a quarter of your cash as stock, if you're over 350k, you can expect around half.     If you have 8+ years of technical experience and your RSU stock is 10% of your comp at a large public company, you're getting ripped off. Don't let them do this to you. (This advice doesn't apply to weird cases like Netflix, where policy says you're paid top of market and comp is entirely in cash. But that's probably the only place it's true).    If you're working at a startup, value your options at $0 and count it as a windfall if you get lucky. If you're comparing startup to Corp comp, get the cap tables and figure out how much the startup would have to sell for to equal your 4 year vest at the public company.     In my experience, startups are fabulous life experience, but basically never will make you wealthy unless you're earlier than employee 10 or 15.     The last offer comparison I made, the startup would have had to sell for 10 billion dollars (seriously) and issue no more stock just to equal the guaranteed comp offer from a large corp over 4 years.    Needless to say, it didn't sell for that.    Editor's Notes: I love this community! Adrian Sanabria @sawaba developed a Salary Comparison Worksheet for #BsidesLV #HireGround. He invites everyone to test, copy and bug test it. Click here to access it.    A few people also mentioned that Levels.fyi has better salary data than other online salary guides. Click here to learn more.    Question 2: What is the salary range you're after?    Response:    If you're truly blind and don't know what the position is worth, ask for at least 40% more than you're making now. Worst case they counter with whatever they were thinking of paying, and you then negotiate 10-20% over that number. I've had mentees who ended up getting 120% raises by just asking for big numbers.    I repeat, once they're seriously having this conversation, they've decided to hire you. They've already invested a bunch of time in finding you, a bunch of valuable people's time interviewing you - you won't offend them into rescinding the offer, and if that does happen, OMG RUN AWAY THE WARNING SIGNS ARE TOO BIG FOR THIS MARGIN.     Your future coworkers will be mad at their boss for not hiring that person they gave the thumbs up to. The hiring manager wants you, take advantage of this.    Question 3: We cannot move forward without a number. What is the minimum base salary you will accept?    Response:    The best advice I've heard about this is let's put down $1 and we'll revisit that when it's relevant. Alternatively, sub a million bucks, or  half a million (but seriously, don't limit yourself to that).     Remember that in basically every case the salary negotiation doesn't really begin until after they've decided they want to hire you. Remember salary and total comp aren't the same thing, if you do cave and let HR badger you into a lowball number, ask for lots more in stock.    Remember that how much money you ask for is always a direct reflection of what career level they hire you at. Don't want to be an IC2? Ask for an IC4 comp.     This is the most consistent way tech companies keep disadvantaged folks salaries down - start them under level and only eventually promote to where they should have been hired at in the first place.     This can be a particularly good reason to start early comp numbers at a higher benchmark, because you'll be interviewed for the higher level position.    Make sure you know who you're taking to. HR will try to wheedle a number of off you, and then limit you to the that value administratively.     One large tech company has a hard policy of only 10% over previous salary. Don't fall for that. Don't negotiate salary with anyone other than your future boss or their boss.     Never give HR a real number, it may tie your bosses hands. Never negotiate numbers before you've been fully interviewed and you know they want to hire you.    In the past, I've named numbers significantly higher than I knew they were going to accept, and had the other party flat out tell me what their expected range for the position was in response. In California they're obligated to tell you the range for the position, but the law is relatively toothless because that's not including stock and contractual bonuses.    Remember that for even lower level technical positions, the total acquisition cost is often 10-20 grand per person that actually gets hired.     Harder to fill positions can pay up to half your first year's salary to the recruiter who brings you in. Once they want you, you have the upper hand. Hiring good people is hard, take advantage of that.

There are bindings for using Tree-sitter from Node.js, Haskell, Ruby and Rust.

In order to produce code that provably satisfies a rich specification, the synthesizer needs an advanced program verification mechanism that is sufficiently expressive and fully automatic. In this talk, I will present a program synthesis technique based on refinement type checking: a verification mechanism that supports automatic reasoning about expressive properties through a combination of types and SMT solving.

390443012,Going Fast and Cheap: How We Made Anna Autoscale - RISE Lab,,"Background: In an earlier blog post, we described a system called Anna, which used a shared-nothing, thread-per-core architecture to achieve lightning-fast speeds by avoiding all coordination mechanisms. Anna also used lattice composition to enable a rich variety of coordination-free consistency levels. The first version of Anna blew existing in-memory KVSes out of the water: Anna is up to 700x faster than Masstree, an earlier state-of-the-art research KVS, and up to 800x faster than Intel’s “lock-free” TBB hash table. You can find the previous blog post here and the full paper here. We refer to that version of Anna as “Anna v0.” In this post, we describe how we extended the fastest KVS in the cloud to be extremely cost-efficient and…",https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/going-fast-and-cheap-how-we-made-anna-autoscale,Computer Science,,2018-09-10T11:11:49.000Z,https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/selective_elasticity-300x269.png,

390443015,[PDF] A Storage Scheme for Multi-dimensional Databases Using Extendible Array Files | Semantic Scholar,,"It is shown how the extendible array file implementation gives an efficient storage scheme for both scientific and OLAP multi-dimensional datasets that are allowed to incrementally grow without incurring the prohibitive costs of reorganizations. Large scale scientific datasets are generally modeled as k-dimensional arrays, since this model is amenable to the form of analyses and visualization of the scientific phenomenon often investigated. In recent years, organizations have adopted the use of on-line analytical processing (OLAP), methods and statistical analyses to make strategic business decisions using enterprise data that are modeled as multi-dimensional arrays as well. In both of these domains, the datasets have the propensity to gradually grow, reaching orders of terabytes. However, the storage schemes used for these arrays correspond to those where the array elements are allocated in a sequence of consecutive locations according to an ordering of array mapping functions that map k-dimensional indices one-to-one onto the linear locations. Such schemes limit the degree of extendibility of the array to one dimension only. We present a method of allocating storage for the elements of a dense multidimensional extendible array such that the bounds on the indices of the respective dimensions can be arbitrarily extended without reorganizing previously allocated elements. We give a mapping function F∗(), and its inverse F −1 ∗ (), for computing the linear address of an array element given its k-dimensional index. The technique adopts the mapping function, for realizing an extendible array with arbitrary extendibility in main memory, to implement such array files. We show how the extendible array file implementation gives an efficient storage scheme for both scientific and OLAP multi-dimensional datasets that are allowed to incrementally grow without incurring the prohibitive costs of reorganizations.

The cost of reconciling consistency and state management with high availability is highly magnified by the unprecedented scale and robustness requirements of today's Internet applications. We propose two strategies for improving overall availability using simple mechanisms that scale over large applications whose output behavior tolerates graceful degradation. We characterize this degradation in terms of harvest and yield, and map it directly onto engineering mechanisms that enhance availability by improving fault isolation, and in some cases also simplify programming. By collecting examples of related techniques in the literature and illustrating the surprising range of applications that can benefit from these approaches, we hope to motivate a broader research program in this area.",https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5015/8bc1a8a67295ab7bce0550886a9859000dc2.pdf,Computer Science,,2017-11-25T19:15:19.000Z,https://www.semanticscholar.org/img/semantic_scholar_og.png,

Nutritional Yeast Tablets: https://shop.drberg.com/nutritional-yeast-regular 

Dr. Berg talks about how to raise your dopamine naturally. It is considered a ""motivation molecule"". Dopamine helps you focus and concentrate better. When someone takes drugs, they are really stimulating dopamine, it's not the drug directly that gives you that sensation. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which needs a strong acidic stomach to turn protein into amino acids (the precursor). Also, insulin resistance can block the ability to absorb amino acids that are needed to make dopamine. L-tyrosine is also a good amino acid to take to build up more dopamine. Being deficient can cause lowered libido, feeling cold, mental sluggishness, and carb craving. Vitamin B1 can also help you make more dopamine. Holy basil, Rhodiola is both great herbs to take to lower stress. But stress or cortisol can block the production of dopamine. Uridine is another compound you can take to increase dopamine levels and this is present in Nutritional Yeast. Also being out in the sun can spike vitamin D and help as well.

Subscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW

If you have poor posture, you not only are aware of it but likely would welcome an easy way to fix it.  In this video, I’m showing you a 4 step plan that can attack the most common posture flaws to give you a nice, tall, upright posture sooner than you think.  I’m going to show you how to hit correct rounded shoulders, a hunched back, crooked neck, forward head and tilted pelvis.  When you apply the easy drills shown here you will start to feel better almost instantly and work towards permanently fixing your bad posture.

The four biggest problem areas for those with bad posture is the neck, shoulders, mid back and pelvis.  Specifically, if you spend a lot of time sitting at a desk or behind the wheel you will wind up getting slumping shoulders and a rounded back.  To counteract the head being pulled downward, you wind up tilting your head up so you can look straight ahead.  This has the effect of overarching your neck and weakening the deep neck flexors.  Finally, when the upper spine curves forward, the pelvis winds up curling under.  This posterior pelvic tilt is something that adaptively tightens the hamstrings and weakens the lower back.

If you want to fix your posture you have to hit each of these areas with individualized attention.  We have actually addressed each of these in depth with the following videos:

How to Fix Rounded Shoulders - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLwTC-lAJws
How to Fix Anterior Pelvic Tilt - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-CrEi0ymMg
How to Fix Posterior Pelvic Tilt - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1sfPfsESDQ
How to Fix a Rounded Upper Back https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-GDuhjOAU8

That said, there is something that you can do for each of these areas that will help you to correct the postural problems without having to spend a long time each day.  These are efficient and effective but do need your consistency in order to make a lasting impact on the correction.  The funny thing about posture is that we often spend a lifetime doing the things that ruin our posture in the first place, yet expect that we will be able to fix it in an hour.

While not an hour, these posture correction exercises will have an immediate impact on the way you feel.  You should feel as if you have more mobility in the tightened areas and that your body begins to move more free and easy.  From here, with a bit of consistency you will be able to make permanent changes in your posture that will have you feeling stronger and looking much better than you do now.

An important note on posture and working out, that I referenced earlier, is that it is not a good idea to lift weights when your body is severely out of alignment.  All you are doing is strengthening poor posture and dysfunction.  Lifting weights in the presence of dysfunction is quickly going to lead to not only other compensations elsewhere in the kinetic chain but likely wind up in injury.  It is much smarter to fix the issues with your posture first and then strengthen your body to reinforce the new perfect posture.

For a complete program that helps you to correct your posture at the same time that you are actually building new muscle and getting ripped, head to http://athleanx.com and get the ATHLEAN-X Training System.  Use the same exact workout routine used by Jesse to not only add muscle to his frame but dramatically improve how he looks when standing.

DATA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3933059/ 

In this video, we’re going to talk about the best foods to clean out your arteries. 

The most inner part of your arteries is called the endothelial layer. If there is a dysfunction with this layer, you can develop inflammation. In turn, this inflammation can cause scarring, calcium deposits, and cholesterol deposits to build up. 

A CAC (coronary artery calcification) test is the absolute best way to detect the state of your arteries. Get one of these tests and, if you have signs of build-up, clean up your diet with the tips below. Have a CAC test every few months until the problem is resolved. 

Here are the best things you can do to clean out your arteries: 

1. Lower your carbohydrates and do intermittent fasting to improve your insulin levels. High insulin causes a massive amount of inflammation throughout your body, which can contribute to clogged arteries and clots. High insulin can also cause AGEs (advanced glycated end products), which is a situation where the proteins inside your arteries become damaged. The first thing you need to do is normalize your insulin levels. 

2. Consume foods rich in vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 lowers the amount of calcium in your blood and transports it to your bones. If you take vitamin D3, make sure you take it with vitamin K2. Natto, liver, eggs, butter, grass-fed beef, cheese, and sauerkraut are great sources of vitamin K2. 

3. Take tocotrienols. Tocotrienols are a form of vitamin E, which is 50X more effective than tocopherols. This is a powerful antioxidant that can help reduce inflammation and promote a healthy cardiovascular system. 

4. Increase omega-3 fatty acids, and lower omega-6 fatty acids. Cut the soy oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, and other vegetable oils out of your diet. Instead, replace them with healthy fats, including fatty fish (such as salmon), cod liver oil, walnuts, and grass-fed meats. A good omega-3 to omega-6 ratio helps supports cardiovascular health. 

5. Increase your potassium. Potassium helps keep your arteries soft and not hardened. 7-10 cups of vegetables a day are vital to maintaining healthy potassium levels. 

Pomegranate is a great remedy for high blood pressure. 

Additionally, vitamin D is important for lowering your inflammation. Get plenty of sunlight or take a vitamin D3 supplement.

Linear algebra provides concepts that are crucial to many areas of computer science, including graphics, image processing, cryptography, machine learning, computer vision, optimization, graph algorithms, quantum computation, computational biology, information retrieval and web search. Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector. In this class, you will learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, and how to use them to think about problems arising in computer science. You will write small programs in the programming language Python to implement basic matrix and vector functionality and algorithms, and use these to process real-world data to achieve such tasks as: two-dimensional graphics transf",http://academictorrents.com/details/54cd86f3038dfd446b037891406ba4e0b1200d5a,Math,,2019-01-28T06:12:45.000Z,https://academictorrents.com/res/img/logo--1200x630.jpg,

The sky is cryin....Can't you see the tears roll down the street
I've been looking for my baby
And I wonder where can she be
I saw my baby early one morning....She was walking on down the street
I saw my baby early this morning....She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat
I've got a real real real real bad feelin
That my baby she don't love me no more
I've got a real real bad feelin that my baby don't love me no more
You know the sky, the sky's been cryin
Can you see the tears roll down my nose

""The Sky Is Crying"" is a song that has become a blues standard. It was written and recorded by Elmore James in 1959

It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state.

Timothy Roscoe, ETH Zurich

A glance at this year's OSDI program shows that Operating Systems are a small niche topic for this conference, not even meriting their own full session. This is unfortunate because good OS design has always been driven by the underlying hardware, and right now that hardware is almost unrecognizable from ten years ago, let alone from the 1960s when Unix was written. This change is receiving considerable attention in the architecture and security communities, for example, but in contrast, so-called OS researchers are mostly in denial. Even the little publishable OS work that is not based on Linux still assumes the same simplistic hardware model (essentially a multiprocessor VAX) that bears little resemblance to modern reality. In this talk, I'll speculate on how we came to this unfortunate state of affairs, and what might be done to fix it. In particular, I'll argue for re-engaging with what computer hardware really is today and give two suggestions (among many) about how the OS research community can usefully do this, and exploit what is actually a tremendous opportunity.

Timothy Roscoe is a Full Professor in the Systems Group of the Computer Science Department at ETH Zurich, where he works on operating systems, networks, and distributed systems, and is currently head of department.

Mothy received a PhD in 1995 from the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, where he was a principal designer and builder of the Nemesis OS. After three years working on web-based collaboration systems at a startup in North Carolina, he joined Sprint's Advanced Technology Lab in Burlingame, California, in 1998, working on cloud computing and network monitoring. He joined Intel Research at Berkeley in April 2002 as a principal architect of PlanetLab, an open, shared platform for developing and deploying planetary-scale services. Mothy joined the Computer Science Department ETH Zurich in January 2007 and was named Fellow of the ACM in 2013 for contributions to operating systems and networking research.

His work has included the Barrelfish multikernel research OS, as well as work on distributed stream processors, and using formal specifications to describe the hardware/software interfaces of modern computer systems. Mothy's current research centers on Enzian, a powerful hybrid CPU/FPGA machine designed for research into systems software.

390443905,Chapter 39. Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan) with CUDA,,"Chapter 39. Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan) with CUDA Mark Harris NVIDIA Corporation Shubhabrata Sengupta University of California, Davis John D. Owens University of California, Davis 39.1 Introduction A simple and common parallel algorithm building block is the all-prefix-sums operation. In this chapter, we define and illustrate the operation, and we discuss in detail its efficient implementation using NVIDIA CUDA. Blelloch (1990) describes all-prefix-sums as a good example of a computation that seems inherently sequential, but for which there is an efficient parallel algorithm. He defines the all-prefix-sums operation as follows: The all-prefix-sums operation takes a binary associative operator with identity I, and an array of n elements [a 0, a 1,..., a n–1], and returns the array [I, a 0, (a 0 a 1),..., (a 0 a 1 ... a n–2)] For example, if is addition, then the all-prefix-sums operation on the array [3 1 7 0 4 1 6 3] would return [0 3 4 11 11 15 16 22]. The all-prefix-sums operation on an array of data is commonly known as scan. We use this simpler terminology (which comes from the APL programming language [Iverson 1962]) for the remainder of this chapter. The scan just defined is an exclusive scan, because each element j of the result is the sum of all elements up to but not including j in the input array. In an inclusive scan, all elements including j are summed. An exclusive scan can be generated from an inclusive scan by shifting the resulting array right by one element and inserting the identity. Likewise, an inclusive scan can be generated from an exclusive scan by shifting the resulting array left and inserting at the end the sum of the last element of the scan and the last element of the input array (Blelloch 1990). For the remainder of this chapter, we focus on the implementation of exclusive scan and refer to it simply as ""scan"" unless otherwise specified. There are many uses for scan, including, but not limited to, sorting, lexical analysis, string comparison, polynomial evaluation, stream compaction, and building histograms and data structures (graphs, trees, and so on) in parallel. For example applications, we refer the reader to the survey by Blelloch (1990). In this chapter, we cover summed-area tables (used for variable-width image filtering), stream compaction, and radix sort. In general, all-prefix-sums can be used to convert certain sequential computations into equivalent, but parallel, computations, as shown in Figure 39-1. Table 39-1. A Sequential Computation and Its Parallel Equivalent Sequential Parallel out[0] = 0; for j from 1 to n do out[j] = out[j-1] + f(in[j-1]); forall j in parallel do temp[j] = f(in[j]); all_prefix_sums(out, temp); 39.1.1 Sequential Scan and Work Efficiency Implementing a sequential version of scan (that could be run in a single thread on a CPU, for example) is trivial. We simply loop over all the elements in the input array and add the value of the previous element of the input array to the sum computed for the previous element of the output array, and write the sum to the current element of the output array. out[0] := 0 for k := 1 to n do out[k] := in[k-1] + out[k-1] This code performs exactly n adds for an array of length n; this is the minimum number of adds required to produce the scanned array. When we develop our parallel version of scan, we would like it to be work-efficient. A parallel computation is work-efficient if it does asymptotically no more work (add operations, in this case) than the sequential version. In other words the two implementations should have the same work complexity, O(n). 39.2 Implementation The sequential scan algorithm is poorly suited to GPUs because it does not take advantage of the GPU's data parallelism. We would like to find a parallel version of scan that can utilize the parallel processors of a GPU to speed up its computation. In this section we work through the CUDA implementation of a parallel scan algorithm. We start by introducing a simple but inefficient implementation and then present improvements to both the algorithm and the implementation in CUDA. 39.2.1 A Naive Parallel Scan The pseudocode in Algorithm 1 shows a first attempt at a parallel scan. This algorithm is based on the scan algorithm presented by Hillis and Steele (1986) and demonstrated for GPUs by Horn (2005). Figure 39-2 illustrates the operation. The problem with Algorithm 1 is apparent if we examine its work complexity. The algorithm performs O(n log2 n) addition operations. Remember that a sequential scan performs O(n) adds. Therefore, this naive implementation is not work-efficient. The factor of log2 n can have a large effect on performance. Figure 39-2 The Naive Scan of Example 1. A Sum Scan Algorithm That Is Not Work-Efficient 1: for d = 1 to log2 n do 2: for all k in parallel do 3: if k 2 d then 4: x[k] = x[k – 2 d-1] + x[k] Algorithm 1 assumes that there are as many processors as data elements. For large arrays on a GPU running CUDA, this is not usually the case. Instead, the programmer must divide the computation among a number of thread blocks that each scans a portion of the array on a single multiprocessor of the GPU. Even still, the number of processors in a multiprocessor is typically much smaller than the number of threads per block, so the hardware automatically partitions the ""for all"" statement into small parallel batches (called warps) that are executed sequentially on the multiprocessor. An NVIDIA 8 Series GPU executes warps of 32 threads in parallel. Because not all threads run simultaneously for arrays larger than the warp size, Algorithm 1 will not work, because it performs the scan in place on the array. The results of one warp will be overwritten by threads in another warp. To solve this problem, we need to double-buffer the array we are scanning using two temporary arrays. Pseudocode for this is given in Algorithm 2, and CUDA C code for the naive scan is given in Listing 39-1. Note that this code will run on only a single thread block of the GPU, and so the size of the arrays it can process is limited (to 512 elements on NVIDIA 8 Series GPUs). Extension of scan to large arrays is discussed in Section 39.2.4. Example 2. A Double-Buffered Version of the Sum Scan from Algorithm 1 1: for d = 1 to log2 n do 2: for all k in parallel do 3: if k 2 d then 4: x[out][k] = x[in][k – 2 d-1] + x[in][k] 5: else 6: x[out][k] = x[in][k] Example 39-1. CUDA C Code for the Naive Scan Algorithm This version can handle arrays only as large as can be processed by a single thread block running on one multiprocessor of a GPU. __global__ void scan(float *g_odata, float *g_idata, int n) { extern __shared__ float temp[]; // allocated on invocation int thid = threadIdx.x; int pout = 0, pin = 1; // Load input into shared memory. // This is exclusive scan, so shift right by one // and set first element to 0 temp[pout*n + thid] = (thid > 0) ? g_idata[thid-1] : 0; __syncthreads(); for (int offset = 1; offset < n; offset *= 2) { pout = 1 - pout; // swap double buffer indices pin = 1 - pout; if (thid >= offset) temp[pout*n+thid] += temp[pin*n+thid - offset]; else temp[pout*n+thid] = temp[pin*n+thid]; __syncthreads(); } g_odata[thid] = temp[pout*n+thid]; // write output } 39.2.2 A Work-Efficient Parallel Scan Our implementation of scan from Section 39.2.1 would probably perform very badly on large arrays due to its work-inefficiency. We would like to find an algorithm that would approach the efficiency of the sequential algorithm, while still taking advantage of the parallelism in the GPU. Our goal in this section is to develop a work-efficient scan algorithm for CUDA that avoids the extra factor of log2 n work performed by the naive algorithm. This algorithm is based on the one presented by Blelloch (1990). To do this we will use an algorithmic pattern that arises often in parallel computing: balanced trees. The idea is to build a balanced binary tree on the input data and sweep it to and from the root to compute the prefix sum. A binary tree with n leaves has d = log2 n levels, and each level d has 2 d nodes. If we perform one add per node, then we will perform O(n) adds on a single traversal of the tree. The tree we build is not an actual data structure, but a concept we use to determine what each thread does at each step of the traversal. In this work-efficient scan algorithm, we perform the operations in place on an array in shared memory. The algorithm consists of two phases: the reduce phase (also known as the up-sweep phase) and the down-sweep phase. In the reduce phase, we traverse the tree from leaves to root computing partial sums at internal nodes of the tree, as shown in Figure 39-3. This is also known as a parallel reduction, because after this phase, the root node (the last node in the array) holds the sum of all nodes in the array. Pseudocode for the reduce phase is given in Algorithm 3. Figure 39-3 An Illustration of the Up-Sweep, or Reduce, Phase of a Work-Efficient Sum Scan Algorithm Example 3. The Up-Sweep (Reduce) Phase of a Work-Efficient Sum Scan Algorithm (After Blelloch 1990) 1: for d = 0 to log2 n – 1 do 2: for all k = 0 to n – 1 by 2 d+1 in parallel do 3: x[k + 2 d+1 – 1] = x[k + 2 d – 1] + x[k + 2 d +1 – 1] In the down-sweep phase, we traverse back down the tree from the root, using the partial sums from the reduce phase to build the scan in place on the array. We start by inserting zero at the root of the tree, and on each step, each node at the current level passes its own value to its left child, and the sum of its value and the former value of its left child to its right child. The down-sweep is shown in Figure 39-4, and pseudocode is given in Algorithm 4. CUDA C code for the complete algorithm is given in Listing 39-2. Like the naive scan code in Section 39.2.1, the code in Listing 39-2 will run on only a single thread block. Because it processes two elements per thread, the maximum array size this code can scan is 1,024 element...",https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-vi-gpu-computing/chapter-39-parallel-prefix-sum-scan-cuda,OS,,2020-04-18T04:31:18.000Z,,

Researchers have found that although 95% of people think they’re self-aware, only 10 to 15% actually are. Un-self-aware colleagues aren’t just frustrating; they can cut a team’s chances of success in half and lead to increased stress, decreased motivation, and higher turnover. So how do we deal with these situations? Is it possible to help the unaware see themselves more clearly? And if we can’t, what can we do to minimize their damage on our success and happiness?",https://hbr.org/2018/10/working-with-people-who-arent-self-aware,Psychology,,2022-10-02T09:59:14.964Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/oct18_22_567145277.jpg,

390444410,"10 Signs of Vulnerable Narcissistic Abuse | The ""Dark Cloud"" Theory of Covert Narcissism",,"This video answers the question: How can one spot vulnerable narcissistic abuse in a romantic relationship? I put together this video of ten signs of vulnerable narcissistic abuse. This applies to romantic relationships and with these particular ten signs, I looked at heterosexual romantic relationships not only in the scientific literature but in my clinical experience. I review the “dark cloud” theory of vulnerable narcissism.

There are two types of narcissism: grandiose and vulnerable. There are characteristics that we see across both types of narcissism that would be self-centeredness, a sense of entitlement, and a need for admiration. Specific to vulnerable narcissism, we see a low level of extraversion (somebody who has vulnerable narcissism tends to be introverted), high neuroticism, anxiety, depression, anger, resentfulness, distrustfulness, insecurity, feelings of shame, hypersensitivity to criticism, defensiveness, socially awkwardness, shyness, pessimism, being unforgiving, internalized anger, aggression, and jealousy.

390443677,23 years of software side channel attacks by Dr. Colin Percival,,"23 years of software side channel attacks

I will present a historical review of software side channel attacks, from Paul Kocher’s 1996 timing attacks against asymmetric cryptography to the latest microarchitectural vulnerabilities. While there have been too many attacks discovered to spend time describing every one, I will highlight attacks which were particularly novel or influential, explaining both the history of how attacks build on earlier work and some of the reasons behind the decisions which led to these attacks being possible.

No knowledge of cryptography will be assumed, but the audience may benefit from a basic understanding of CPU architecture (instructions, pipelining, caches, etc).

390442634,Deprecating the Observer Pattern,,Programming interactive systems by means of the observer pattern is hard and error-prone yet is still the implementation standard in many production environments. We present an approach to gradually deprecate observers in favor of reactive programming abstractions. Several library layers help programmers to smoothly migrate existing code from callbacks to a more declarative programming model. Our central high-level API layer embeds an extensible higher-order data-flow DSL into our host language. This embedding is enabled by a continuation passing style transformation.,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148043,Software Engineering,,2016-05-28T19:18:04.000Z,,

390444046,Software Design for Flexibility,,"Strategies for building systems that can be adapted for new situations with only minor programming modifications.Time pressures encourage programmers to write code that works well for a narrow purpose, with no room to grow. But the best systems are evolvable; they can be adapted for new situations by adding code, rather than changing the existing code. The authors describe techniques they have found effective—over their combined 100-plus years of programming experience—that will help programmers avoid programming themselves into corners.The authors explore ways to enhance flexibility by:• Organizing systems using combinators to compose mix-and-match parts, ranging from small functions to whole arithmetics, with standardized interfaces• Augmenting data with independent annotation layers, such as units of measurement or provenance• Combining independent pieces of partial information using unification or propagation• Separating control structure from problem domain with domain models, rule systems and pattern matching, propagation, and dependency-directed backtracking• Extending the programming language, using dynamically extensible evaluatorsSome of the techniques, such as dynamically extensible generic procedures, are extremely powerful but potentially dangerous. Each chapter includes exercises. Code is written in Scheme, a simple dialect of Lisp. Examples range from astronomy to automatic differentiation to an adventure game.",https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/software-design-flexibility,Software Engineering,,2021-03-20T05:33:05.000Z,,

533769680,What a good debugger can do,,"When people say “debuggers are useless and using logging and unit-tests is much better,” I suspect many of them think that debuggers can only put breakpoints on certain lines, step-step-step through the code, and check variable values. Whereas any reasonable debugger can indeed do all of that, it’s only the tip of the iceberg. Think about it; we could already step through the code 40 years ago, surely some things have changed? Tl;dr – in this episode of old-man-yells-at-cloud, you will learn that a good debugger supports different kinds of breakpoints, offers rich data visualization capabilities, has a REPL for executing expressions, can show the dependencies between threads and control their execution, pick up changes in the source code and apply them without restarting the program, can step through the code backward and rewind the program state to any point in history, and even record the entire program execution and visualize control flow and data flow history. I should mention that the perfect debugger doesn’t exist. Different tools support different features and have different limitations. As usual, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, but it’s important to understand what’s theoretically possible and what we should strive for. In this article, I will describe different debugging features and techniques and discuss the existing tools/products that offer them.  Disclaimer. In this article I mention various free and commercial products as examples. I’m not being paid or incentivised in any other way by the companies behind those products (although I will not say no to free swag should they decide to send me some cough-cough). My goal is to raise awareness and challenge the popular belief that “debuggers are useless, let’s just printf”.",https://werat.dev/blog/what-a-good-debugger-can-do/,Tools,,2023-03-12T03:25:18.778Z,https://werat.dev/blog/what-a-good-debugger-can-do/old-man-yells-at-cloud.jpeg,

TransLink, Vancouver’s transit operator, will collect data on bus and charging station cross-compatibility as well as bus performance, maintenance, and overall customer experience.

Software visualization is as old as software engineering, but it still only has limited day-to-day applications. The potential benefit of visualization stays largely untapped, while the software community is facing a big problem: Professional software developers spend most of their development time on reading and understanding existing source code, instead of actually writing new one. Thus, a lot of their productivity is lost. 

Visualization leverages research on human visual perception. Its use allows us to process and understand information much quicker than information provided solely in textual form. We will see how these laws are used by different software visualization fields to improve comprehension of certain aspects of a software system. Applying the introduced design principles we will develop a simple visual notation that helps to accelerate understanding source code. Sourcetrail, a cross-platform source explorer built on top of the LLVM/Clang LibTooling library, will be used to demonstrate how such a visual notation simplifies getting to know a large code base in practice.

390443683,Evan Buswell | Undefined Intimacy with the Machine,,"This is an investigation into some aspects of the way the C programming language creates meaning. In any formalized language, meaning is created by a tension between a community of speakers and the language's formal definition. In the case of C, this community preceded and presided over the formal definition in such a way that the formal definition itself embodies this tension. Because of this, C has a relatively unique view on how programming languages work, and how language in general should work. Specifically, I will argue that the 1989 ANSI C standard introduces the concept of abstraction by ambiguity into formal language specifications. Paradoxically, this ambiguity allows the knowledgeable programmer to be more specific than would otherwise be possible, while retaining the extensional benefits of abstraction. This has implications for philosophy of language in general, which I will briefly address.This work is situated in the emerging field of critical code studies (Marino). Although there has been related work dating all the way back into the 80s and 90s (Knuth; Winograd; Landow; Kittler), most studies that self-consciously look at code itself from a perspective that goes beyond computer science are a very recent phenomenon (Fuller; Chun). If much of my investigation seems overly broad, then, that's to be expected: just as a Polaroid photograph develops with broad splotches of color, only acquiring precision at the end of the process, likewise a new investigation must be satisfied with the faith that its clumsiness will be turned into precision with time. Many things herein are assertions with little corresponding argument, yet assertions which nevertheless to me seemed interesting enough to present for consideration in the hope that they might function as depth-soundings for future navigation.",http://thoughtmesh.net/publish/367.php,Unread,,2019-11-17T02:53:42.000Z,,

390443397,"Watch ""The Paxos Algorithm"" on YouTube",,"A Google TechTalk, 2/2/18, presented by Luis Quesada Torres.
ABSTRACT: This Tech Talk presents the Paxos algorithm and discusses a fictional distributed storage system (i.e. simplified Megastore) based on Paxos.

The Paxos algorithm is one of the most common consensus algorithms. Consensus algorithms are one of the mechanisms that allow satisfying consistency constraints in distributed systems with consistency constraints, whether they follow a leader-replica schema or a peer-to-peer schema.

Leader-replica systems consist of a leader node that proposes, manages, accepts, and serializes changes, and replica nodes that propose changes to the current leader node. Given that a single entity is in charge of acception and serialization, leader-replica systems do not require consensus algorithms in order to agree on what the next state is. However, if the leader node becomes unreachable, the replica nodes need to agree on which one should become the next leader node, and they usually run consensus algorithms to reach that agreement.

Peer-to-peer systems consist of nodes that can propose changes and participate in accepting changes. The nodes need to agree on what the next state is in order to establish consistency, and they usually run consensus algorithms to reach that agreement.

SREs within and outside Google work with highly scalable (and therefore distributed) systems that have consistency constraints and involve consensus algorithms.

390443050,"Road Safety Impact of Increased Rural Highway Speed Limits in British Columbia, Canada",,"Control of vehicle speed is a central tenet of the safe systems approach to road safety. Most research shows that raising speed limits results in more injuries. Advocates of higher speed limits argue that this conclusion is based on older research, that traffic fatalities are decreasing despite higher speed limits, and that modern vehicles are able to safely travel at higher speeds. These arguments were used to justify raising speed limits on rural highways in British Columbia, Canada (July 2014). We used an interrupted time series approach to evaluate the impact of these speed limit increases on fatal crashes, auto-insurance claims, and ambulance dispatches for road trauma. Events were mapped to affected road segments (with increased speed limits) and to nearby road segments (within 5 km of an affected segment). Separate linear regression models were fitted for each outcome and road segment group. Models included gasoline sales to account for changes in vehicle travel. Our main findings were significant increases in (i) total insurance claims (43.0%; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 16.0&ndash;76.4%), (ii) injury claims (30.0%; 95% CI = 9.5&ndash;54.2%), and (iii) fatal crashes (118.0; 95% CI = 10.9&ndash;225.1%) on affected road segments. Nearby segments had a 25.7% increase in insurance claims (95% CI = 16.1&ndash;36.1%).",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/10/3555,Unread,,2018-10-11T19:22:31.000Z,https://www.mdpi.com/img/journals/sustainability-logo-sq.png?d4d6ba04cc06d9f2,
